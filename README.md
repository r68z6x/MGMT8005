Assessment 2
Semester 2, 2024
Assessment Overview:
The Yamatji Southern Regional Corporation (YSRC) was established in 2020 through an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) with the Western Australian Government. This agreement allocates Yamatji potential ownership/management of over 1300 land parcels (see map and link below). YSRC seeks to maximise benefits for the Yamatji Nation People through these lands, including exploring renewable energy opportunities.

Problem Statement:
The implementation and utilisation of renewable energy projects are not without risks. These risks can stem from various sources, including environmental, technical, economic, social, cultural, and regulatory factors. To ensure the success and sustainability of these projects, it is crucial to identify, assess, and manage these risks effectively.
Specifically, selecting a suitable land parcel for renewable energy projects requires a comprehensive risk assessment. This assessment will evaluate the risks associated with the development and operation of renewable energy facilities on the YSRC-managed lands. By conducting a thorough risk assessment, YSRC aims to make informed decisions that will enhance the potential benefits for the Yamatji Nation People while mitigating any adverse impacts.
Purpose of the Assessment:
The purpose of this assignment is to equip students with practical risk management skills by analysing a real-world problem related to renewable energy projects on YSRC-managed lands. Students are required to:
